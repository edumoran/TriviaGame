# Trivia Game
This is a short movie trivia I did. I used JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

## How this works
* The game starts with a welcome screen with a short intro and displaying the instructions.
* Once you click start, the questionnaire will be displayed and a 90 seconds counter will begin.
* There are 10 multiple choice questions from very popular 80's movies, you can only pick one answer so choose wisely.
* Once you finish (if you can), click the submit button. The results page will be displayed after with your score and a short comment on how you did.
*When the counter reaches 0, the results page will be automatically displayed and your score will be shown.
